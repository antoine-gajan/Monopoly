# Monopoly (Web Front-end)

## 💻︎ Contents of the repository :

This GitHub repository contains all the code of the Web Front-end produced during the EINA Monopoly software project in 2023.


## 🎯 Course Objectives:

- Participate in a team effort to complete a major project
- Learning project management
- Design a powerful software architecture
- Self-taught training in new languages


## 🧑‍💻 Technologies used:

The MEARN stack was used to perform the front end of the software. In particular, we used Angular (HTML, CSS, TypeScript) to code and we used a MongoDB database for data persistence.


## 💡Proposed Features: 

Our software allows from an online interface to create a user account, to connect and modify its information as well as to play a part of Monopoly (EINA version) with other players. During this game, the player will be able to roll the dice and buy properties (courses) as in the real game. Some aspects of the game have been revisited to allow for increased user experience. 

## 💡Execute the code:

The GitHub organization created for this project can be found at:  https://github.com/UNIZAR-30226-2023-11 
You will find all the information to link the front end to the back end here.
